# MCP2.0
1. Key Limitations of MCP
1.	JSON-RPC Overhead & Lack of IPA-Grade Typing
o	MCP’s reliance on JSON-RPC 2.0 makes it easy to implement in any language, but it also incurs significant parsing overhead for large payloads.
o	Because JSON is untyped, both client and server need to agree on schemas out‐of‐band. This can lead to runtime errors when an unsupported field or type sneaks through.
2.	Limited Native Streaming Support
o	Most MCP servers/clients treat each request/response as self‐contained. Streaming large datasets (e.g., hundreds of megabytes of logs, long audio transcripts, or real-time telemetry) often becomes a clunky multipart workaround rather than native.
3.	No Built-In Service Discovery or Capability Negotiation
o	While MCP defines “capabilities” in the sense of metadata tags, there’s no canonical, dynamic registry for discovering which MCP servers are available on a network. In practice, users still need to hard-code endpoints or manage their own service directories.
4.	Coarse-Grained Security Scoping
o	MCP’s OAuth-style tokens can gate access to broad categories (e.g., “read/write to this database”). But there’s no unified, fine-grained capability model (like capability URIs or object-capability tokens) that lets an LLM client prove it only wants “SELECT on table X” or “invoke function Y with arguments Z.”
5.	Weak Multimodal & Event-Driven Patterns
o	When the client needs to send mixed streams of text, image, and audio (e.g., a single MCP call that contains a short video clip plus a text prompt), implementers currently resort to base64‐encoded blobs inside JSON. MCP doesn’t define a first-class way to mark “this parameter is a live camera feed,” “this parameter is a chunked audio stream,” or “this parameter is a protobuf‐encoded point cloud.”
6.	Single-Agent Focus
o	MCP was explicitly crafted for “one LLM agent interacting with one data/tool server.” Higher-order patterns—where two MCP-enabled agents negotiate a task or piggyback on each other’s exposed contexts—require ad‐hoc bridging logic. (That becomes A2A territory.)
________________________________________
2. Design Goals for “MCP 2.0” (a Next-Gen Protocol)
1.	Low-Latency, Typed RPC
o	Switch to a binary, schema-driven transport (e.g., Protocol Buffers over gRPC or Cap’n Proto) to reduce parsing overhead and guarantee end-to-end type safety.
o	Define a minimal core schema for “ContextRequest,” “ContextResponse,” and “ToolInvocation” messages. Every field must be versioned explicitly.
2.	Built-In Streaming & Multimodal Channels
o	Embed first-class support for unary, server-stream, client-stream, and bi-directional stream methods—so an LLM can receive a 30 fps video feed or send a chunked audio stream without workaround.
o	Standardize an envelope that carries “TextChunk,” “ImageFrame,” “AudioFrame,” and “BinaryBlob” under one gRPC service.
3.	Dynamic Service Discovery & Capability Broadcasting
o	Include a “Discovery” service in the core spec:
	Register(serverName, capabilitiesList, ACLMetadata)
	Lookup(requesterToken, capabilityFilter) → list<EndpointDescriptor>
o	Each server or agent advertises a well-known “Service Card” (much like A2A’s Agent Card but at the MCP layer) describing supported tool methods, data schemas, version constraints, and security requirements.
4.	Fine-Grained, Capability-Based Security
o	Instead of “MCP ReadOnly” or “MCP ReadWrite” tokens, issue object-capability tokens that encode exactly which methods (and even which parameters) the client is allowed to call.
o	Use something like macaroons or CAPBAC: each token carries verifiable metadata (scopes, expiration, allowed parameters), and servers can cryptographically check that inbound calls match the token’s mini-policy.
5.	Pluggable Middleware for Observability, Caching, and Retries
o	Define hooks so that any MCP 2.0 client or server can inject:
	Telemetry/Coverage Logging (e.g., “which client IP invoked which tool X at what time?”)
	Distributed Caching Layers (clients can query a TTL cache proxy before going to the server, reducing latency for hot data).
	Circuit Breakers & Retries (if a data source is down, the middleware can automatically retry or redirect to a read-only replica).
6.	Native Support for Composite (Agent-to-Agent) Chaining
o	Although MCP 2.0 remains fundamentally a “client ↔ server” protocol, it should include a chain-of-proxy mechanism that lets one agent appear as a server for the next agent. In practice, this means:
1.	Agent A obtains a capability token from the enterprise registry.
2.	Agent A passes a derived, restricted token to Agent B, along with a “proof of invocation” signature.
3.	Agent B can then invoke Agent A’s “exposed embedding lookup” or “temporary cache” endpoints through the same protocol, with all calls bearer-token authenticated.
o	By embedding a minimal “AgentDelegation” header field in every RPC, MCP 2.0 can support end-to-end traces across multiple agent hops.
3. Concrete Feature Proposals
3.1. Core Service Definition (gRPC + Protobuf)
protobuf
 
syntax = "proto3";

package mcp2;

// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. Discovery Service
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
service Discovery {
  // Register this server (or agent) & its capabilities with the global registry

  // A server-streaming call: subscribe to live telemetry

  // A bidirectional stream: exchange multimodal data
  rpc MultiModalExchange(stream MultiModalFrame) returns (stream MultiModalFrame);

  // A unary call to invoke a specific tool or action
  rpc InvokeTool(ToolRequest) returns (ToolResponse);
}

message ContextRequest {
  string context_key = 1;             // e.g., “inventory:product_12345:stock_count”
  map<string, bytes> parameters = 2;  // e.g., {"filter":"warehouse=NY,qty>0"}
  bytes capability_token = 3;         // must include “db:inventory:read” scope
  // Optional “agent_delegation” header if delegated by another agent
  bytes agent_delegation_proof = 4;  
}

message ContextResponse {
  bytes serialized_value = 1;         // e.g., protobuf/Avro-encoded data blob
  repeated string metadata = 2;       // e.g., ["timestamp:2025-06-01T08:00:00Z"]
}

message TelemetryRequest {
  string stream_id = 1;               // e.g., “fleet123:engine_temp”
  bytes capability_token = 2;         // must include “telemetry:read” scope
}

message TelemetryFrame {
  int64 timestamp_ms = 1;
  bytes payload = 2;                  // raw sensor data, e.g., Proto-encoded
}

message MultiModalFrame {
  oneof data {
    TextChunk text = 1;
    ImageFrame image = 2;
    AudioFrame audio = 3;
    BinaryBlob blob = 4;
  }
}

message TextChunk {
  string content = 1;
  int32 sequence = 2;                 // ordering for reassembly
}

message ImageFrame {
  bytes jpeg_data = 1;
  int32 width = 2;
  int32 height = 3;

}

message AudioFrame {
  bytes pcm_data = 1;
  int64 timestamp_ms = 2;
}

  bytes data = 1;
  string mime_type = 2;               // e.g., "application/pdf"
  int32 sequence = 3;
}

message ToolRequest {
  string tool_name = 1;               // e.g., “enhance_image”, “sql_query”
  map<string, bytes> arguments = 2;   // key→value pairs for that tool
  bytes capability_token = 3;         // must include “tool:enhance_image” scope
  bytes agent_delegation_proof = 4;   // if delegated
}

message ToolResponse {
  bool success = 1;
  map<string, bytes> outputs = 2;     // e.g., {"enhanced_image_jpeg": <...>}
  repeated string warnings = 3;
}
Rationale for This Core Definition
•	Protocol Buffers guarantee that every field is typed and versioned. If you later add int64 criticality_score = 5; to ToolRequest, old clients simply ignore it and new clients can read it—no silent runtime errors.
•	gRPC (over HTTP/2) provides built-in support for all four RPC modes (unary, server-stream, client-stream, bidi-stream) without extra plumbing.
•	Embedding multiple data shapes (text, image, audio, blob) in a single MultiModalFrame lets clients and servers seamlessly negotiate whether they want a text-only, image-only, or mixed exchange.
•	Everything is Bearer Token + Object Capability; servers validate that the token they receive actually contains the minimal permissions to execute the requested operation on the requested resource.
________________________________________
3.2. Fine-Grained Capability Tokens
Instead of “I have an OAuth token that says I can call any /InvokeTool method,” we issue a capability token that encodes:
•	Subject: the agent/LLM client ID (e.g., “agent12345”)
•	Issuer: the corporate Identity Provider (IdP) or token service
•	Allowed Method(s): one or more of
o	ContextTool.RequestContext(context_keyPattern="inventory:*", allowedParams=[“filter”])
o	ContextTool.InvokeTool(tool_name="encrypt_data", allowedParams=[“plaintext”])
•	Validity Window: issuance timestamp + TTL (e.g., expires_at=2025-06-15T00:00:00Z)
•	Audience: which MCP 2.0 server(s) can accept this token (e.g., aud=["inventoryDBServer"])
A lightweight JSON Web Token (JWT) or Macaroon could carry these constraints in its claims. At call time, the server verifies:
1.	Token signature (to ensure it wasn’t forged)
2.	now <= expires_at
3.	The requested method (e.g., InvokeTool(enhance_image)) matches Allowed Method(s) in the token.
4.	If ContextRequest.context_key="inventory:prod123", ensure it matches "inventory:*" pattern from capability_token.
________________________________________
3.3. Dynamic Service Discovery
Rather than requiring each agent to be manually configured with every MCP endpoint, we introduce a Discovery Registry. All MCP 2.0 servers (databases, caching layers, specialized tool chains) register themselves under:
•	ServerName (unique string)
•	List of Capabilities (e.g., ["db:inventory:read", "db:inventory:write"])
•	Optional Tags (e.g., region="us-east-1", latency≈10ms)
A simplified workflow:
1.	Server S boots up, obtains a registration token from the IdP, and calls Discovery.Register({server_name:"S", capabilities:[…], registration_token:T}).
2.	Registry records this in a distributed key–value store (e.g., etcd or Consul).
3.	Agent A wants to query the inventory. It already holds a capability token for "db:inventory:read". It calls Discovery.Lookup({requester_token:T_A, capability_filter:["db:inventory:read"]}).
4.	Registry returns a list like
jsonc
 
[
  { "server_name": "InventoryDB_Replica1", "grpc_url": "10.0.2.45:55051", "capabilities":["db:inventory:read"] },
  { "server_name": "InventoryDB_Primary",  "grpc_url": "10.0.2.33:55051", "capabilities":["db:inventory:read","db:inventory:write"] }
]
5.	Agent A picks the lowest-latency endpoint (Replica1) and talks to it directly via ContextTool.RequestContext({...}), presenting its same capability token.
Because the registry itself enforces that the token holder has can_lookup="db:inventory:read", unauthorized clients never get a list of endpoints.
________________________________________
3.4. Native Event‐Driven (Publish/Subscribe)
Beyond unary RPCs, many use cases require eventing (e.g., “notify me when stock of product X drops below 10”). MCP 2.0 can layer on a minimal pub/sub feature:
protobuf
 
service EventBus {
  // Publisher publishes events under a topic
  rpc Publish(EventPublishRequest) returns (EventPublishResponse);

  // Subscriber opens a stream to receive events under topics it’s authorized for
  rpc Subscribe(EventSubscribeRequest) returns (stream EventEnvelope);
}

message EventPublishRequest {
  string topic = 1;              // e.g., "inventory:prod123:low_stock"
  bytes payload = 2;             // e.g., {"current_stock":9,"timestamp":...}
  bytes publisher_token = 3;     // must include "event:publish:inventory:*" scope
}

message EventPublishResponse {
  bool success = 1;
  string message = 2;
}

message EventSubscribeRequest {
  string topic_filter = 1;       // e.g., "inventory:*:low_stock"
  bytes subscriber_token = 2;    // must include "event:subscribe:inventory:*"
}

message EventEnvelope {
  string topic = 1;
  bytes payload = 2;
  int64 sequence_id = 3;
}
•	This pub/sub layer can run on the same gRPC server, or be a sidecar.
•	All pub/sub messages are authenticated via tokens scoped to the exact topic patterns.
•	LLM agents can say, “Stream me inventory:prod123:low_stock events,” and the server would push each matching EventEnvelope down a bidi stream.

4. Illustrative End-to-End Flow
Below is a step-by-step scenario showing how MCP 2.0 might look in practice:
1.	Setup
o	An enterprise runs an MCP 2.0 Registry Service at registry.company.local:55050.
o	A specialized “InventoryDB” server is coded against the mcp2.ContextTool and mcp2.EventBus services. It starts up, presents its IAM credential to the registry, and calls:
text
 
Discovery.Register({
  server_name: "InventoryDB_Primary",
  capabilities: ["db:inventory:read","db:inventory:write","event:publish:inventory:*"],
  registration_token: <signed_by_Enterprise_IdP>
})
o	The registry writes this into the cluster store.
o	Later, a second node “InventoryDB_Replica1” registers similarly with only db:inventory:read.
2.	Agent Initialization
o	Agent A (an LLM agent running in Azure Function) fetches a scoped capability token from the corporate IdP:
json
 
{
  "sub":"agentA_id123",
  "iss":"corpIdP.company.local",
  "aud":["InventoryDB_*"],
  "capabilities": ["db:inventory:read","event:subscribe:inventory:*"],
  "exp":"2025-07-01T00:00:00Z"
}
o	Agent A also fetches a second token for image processing from “ImageEnhancer” (another MCP 2.0 server).
3.	Service Discovery & Context Request
o	Agent A calls:
text
 
Discovery.Lookup({
  requester_token: <agentA_token>,
  capability_filter: ["db:inventory:read"]
})
o	Registry responds with:
json
 
[
  {
    "server_name": "InventoryDB_Replica1",
    "grpc_url": "inventory-replica1:55051",
    "capabilities": ["db:inventory:read"]
  },
  {
    "server_name": "InventoryDB_Primary",
    "grpc_url": "inventory-primary:55051",
    "capabilities": ["db:inventory:read","db:inventory:write"]
  }
]
o	Agent A picks InventoryDB_Replica1.
o	Agent A calls:
text
 
ContextTool.RequestContext({
  context_key: "inventory:prod_12345:stock_count",
  parameters: { "filter": "warehouse='NY', qty>0" },
  capability_token: <agentA_token>
})
o	Replica1 validates that agentA_token indeed allows ContextRequest(context_key="inventory:*"). It returns a protobuf‐encoded response with {stock_count: 42}, plus a metadata tag ["timestamp:2025-06-01T08:00:00Z"].
4.	Subscribe to Low-Stock Events
o	Agent A wants to be notified whenever prod_12345’s stock dips below 10. It calls:
text
 
EventBus.Subscribe({
  topic_filter: "inventory:prod_12345:low_stock",
  subscriber_token: <agentA_token>
})
o	The stream remains open. As soon as stock falls below 10 (inside InventoryDB), that server issues:
text
 
EventBus.Publish({
  topic: "inventory:prod_12345:low_stock",
  payload: <encoded {current_stock:9, timestamp:…}>,
  publisher_token: <inventorydb_token>
})
o	Agent A’s subscription stream yields an EventEnvelope with topic="inventory:prod_12345:low_stock" and payload.
5.	Delegating a Tool Invocation to an Image Server
o	User’s chat prompt: “Here is an image from the warehouse camera. Enhance the text overlay so I can read the date stamp.”
o	Agent A has already discovered and fetched a token for ImageEnhancer. It calls:
text
 
Discovery.Lookup({
  requester_token: <agentA_image_token>,
  capability_filter: ["tool:enhance_image"]
})
o	Registry returns the endpoint(s) for “ImageEnhancerServer.”
o	Agent A then streams the raw JPEG frames via ContextTool.MultiModalExchange:
yaml
 
[ MultiModalFrame { data: ImageFrame { jpeg_data: <chunk1>, sequence:1 } },
  MultiModalFrame { data: ImageFrame { jpeg_data: <chunk2>, sequence:2 } } ]
o	ImageEnhancerServer returns a bidi stream of enhanced frames.
o	Agent A reassembles them and embeds the enhanced image back into its chat response.
6.	Agent-to-Agent Chaining
o	Suppose Agent A realizes it needs “business logic” on top of the raw stock count—something only Agent B (the “PricingRulesAgent”) knows how to compute.
o	Agent A has previously fetched a delegation token from the registry that allows delegating a subset of its capabilities to Agent B. It constructs:
text
 
agent_delegation_proof = sign(
  {
    "issuer":"corpIdP",
    "delegator":"agentA_id123",
    "delegatee":"agentB_id987",
    "capabilities":["tool:compute_pricing"],
    "exp":"2025-06-02T00:00:00Z"
  },
  delegator_private_key
)
o	Agent A calls Discovery.Lookup({requester_token: agentA_token, capability_filter:["tool:compute_pricing"]}) and finds Agent B’s endpoint.
o	Agent A calls:
php
 
ToolRequest({
  tool_name: "compute_pricing",
  arguments: { "sku":"prod_12345", "stock_count": 42 },
  capability_token: <agentA_token>,
  agent_delegation_proof: <signed_payload>
})
o	Agent B verifies the delegation proof (confirming Agent A allowed it to invoke compute_pricing), then uses its own logic + MPL calls (perhaps even calling MCP 2.0 to read historical sales). It returns:
text
 
ToolResponse({
  success: true,
  outputs: { "recommended_price": <bytes representing float 37.95> }
})
o	Agent A synthesizes the final answer for the end user.
________________________________________
5. Why This Is “Better” Than MCP 1.0
1.	End-to-End Typing & Versioning
o	No more “field not found” or silent JSON errors. Every message is governed by a protobuf definition. New fields are safely ignored by older clients.
2.	Zero-Boilerplate Streaming
o	gRPC’s native streams allow true low-latency, chunked transfers of video/audio/text without hacks (e.g., worrying about base64-over-JSON size bloat).
3.	Unified Discovery & Capability Model
o	Because every MCP 2.0 server registers its Service Card, agents don’t need manual endpoint configuration. They simply ask “Which endpoints speak db:inventory:read right now?”
o	The registry enforces ACL checks at lookup time, preventing unauthorized enumeration.
4.	Fine-Grained Security
o	Object-capability tokens ensure that if an agent is compromised, the blast radius is constrained to exactly the minimal methods/parameters it should see.
o	No more “all-or-nothing” OAuth scopes that often require backend guards or custom validation code.
5.	First-Class Eventing
o	Publish/sub-scribe semantics let agents “listen” for state changes (e.g., stock < 10) rather than polling at intervals. That reduces load on the servers and improves responsiveness.
6.	Built-In Agent Delegation
o	MCP 1.0 had no explicit concept of “here’s a token I can pass you so you can act on my behalf.” In MCP 2.0, delegation is baked into the protocol via the agent_delegation_proof field.
o	That makes multi-agent pipelines more transparent and auditable.
7.	Pluggable Observability & Caching Middlewares
o	By factoring out telemetry, caching, and circuit breaking into swappable middleware components, implementers can “drop in” NFAs (non-functional assurances) without rewriting core logic.
o	This reduces boilerplate across every new MCP-capable server or client.
________________________________________
**6. Potential Drawbacks & Trade-Offs**
   
**1.	Increased Complexity & Setup Overhead**
   
o	Moving from plain JSON-RPC to gRPC/Protobuf requires a schema registry, code generation, and deeper build setup in each language.
o	Teams that only need a “quick hack” may find MCP 1.0’s minimal JSON approach more approachable.

**2.	Operational Burden for the Registry**
o	Running a distributed service registry (etcd/Consul) is another moving part. If the registry goes down, new agents can’t discover endpoints.
o	High-availability (HA) setups mitigate that, but at extra cost.

**3.	Learning Curve for Object-Capabilities**
o	Teams unfamiliar with capability-based security (macaroons, for example) will need to invest in training.
o	However, that payoff is strong for large enterprises that genuinely need least-privilege delegation.

**4.	Version Skews in Mixed Deployments**
o	Until every MCP participant upgrades, you might have a hybrid environment where some servers speak MCP 1.0 and others speak MCP 2.0.
o	Designing a seamless fallback layer (e.g., a JSON-RPC→gRPC shim) is possible but requires work.
